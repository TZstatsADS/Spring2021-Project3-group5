# Project: Can you recognize the emotion from an image of a face?


### Figs folder

The figures in this folder show our tuning process and model selection. From figures comparing AUC and Accuracies for Random Forest Model (rf_accu_nodes.png, rf_accu_ntrees.png, rf_auc_nodes.png, rf_auc_ntree.png, and rf_mtry.png), we can see that some sepcific RF models with sepcific tree and node numbers have the largest AUC and Accuracies. 
From Model Selectoin figures, we can see the accuracies, AUCs, Training Time, and Testing Time for each model.
